# A66 Lunch Planner

### A66 lunch planner using React with Slack integration

Select a place where you'd like to eat, share it on Slack, let people join on the web interface within a certain time period, and send out finalized information to participants (name of place, time to start, link to directions in gmaps, etc).

The app can have some kind of admin interface for managing restaurant data, and collect statistics on popular places. It can also make recommendations based on these stats.
